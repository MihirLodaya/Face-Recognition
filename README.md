# Face Recognition
Built using [dlib](http://dlib.net/)'s state-of-the-art face recognition
built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the
[Labeled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) benchmark.

You can even use this library with other Python libraries to do real-time face recognition:

The script essentially captures video frames from your webcam, processes them to detect and recognize faces using the loaded encodings, and displays the frames with recognized names and bounding boxes. Pressing the "q" key will stop the script and close the OpenCV windows. Make sure you have the simple_facerec library installed in your environment, and ensure your webcam is accessible and properly configured.
